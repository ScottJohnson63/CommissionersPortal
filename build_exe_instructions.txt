# How to package this Python script as an executable (EXE)

1. Install PyInstaller (only needs to be done once):
   pip install pyinstaller

2. Open a terminal in this project directory.

3. Run the following command to build the EXE:
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py

   - The --onefile flag creates a single EXE file.
   - The --noconsole flag hides the terminal window (for GUI apps).

4. The EXE will be created in the `dist` folder as `main.exe`.

5. To run the app, double-click `dist/main.exe` or distribute that file.

# Notes
- Make sure all dependencies in requirements.txt are installed in your environment before building.
- If you use images or other data files, you may need to add them with the --add-data option.
- If you encounter issues with missing DLLs or modules, consult the PyInstaller documentation for troubleshooting.
